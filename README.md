### A Tech Challenge for WickedFile 🏁

**By Chris Collins ([ca-collins](https://github.com/ca-collins)) and ChatGPT 🤖**

That's right! I am proud to say I used AI (ChatGPT, GH Copilot) heavily in this challenge. In my view, it is now an essential tool and a force multiplier for all software engineers.

I'm sure you all at WickedFile understand more than most why AI is so powerful, but if you'll indulge me with this metaphor I like to use:

_ChatGPT is the steadfast workhorse, tirelessly plowing through the field. It's doing the lions share of the hard work but it's the skilled farmer - the modern software engineer - whose expert, context-aware guidance is essential in having a bountiful harvest._ 🚜🌾🌾
